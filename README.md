# Wave Function Collapse

This repository contains a very basic C++ implementation of the Wave Function Collapse algorithm. The Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm is a technique used in procedural generation to create patterns and layouts based on a given set of input samples.

The Wave Function Collapse algorithm is particularly useful for generating tile-based or grid-based patterns that exhibit local coherence while preserving global constraints. It has been used in various applications such as level generation in video games, texture synthesis, and terrain generation.
